ColoRead is a digital art program that makes designing posters, fliers, and other digital media easier. 

ColoRead uses a simple algorithm to scan the pictures and graphics you wish to use for a digital arts project, identify the main colors present, and generate custom color themes to complement your picture. You can then use these or any other themes to create your digital media project using any of our 200+ fonts and 500+ designs, or import your own!
